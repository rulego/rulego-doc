# Publishing to the RuleGo Marketplace

The RuleGo Marketplace welcomes listing applications from partners and community developers. Your contributions will further enrich the RuleGo ecosystem.  
After the component is merged into the main branch, it will be synchronized to the [RuleGo Marketplace](http://8.134.32.225:9090/editor/) for users to use.

## Component Publishing Process

Publishing a component to the RuleGo Marketplace involves the following steps:

### 1. Complete Component Development and Testing

- Ensure that your component has undergone thorough testing, is stable, and has no significant bugs.
- The component should adhere to RuleGo's design specifications and best practices.
- The component's DSL file should be complete and conform to RuleGo's DSL specifications.

### 2. Prepare Component Publishing Materials

- The component's DSL file (in JSON format).
- Detailed documentation for the component, including functional descriptions, usage guides, parameter explanations, etc.
- Version information for the component.

### 3. Submit the Component to the RuleGo Marketplace

- Submit the component's DSL file and related materials to the RuleGo component repository: [https://github.com/rulego/rulego-components-marketplace](https://github.com/rulego/rulego-components-marketplace)
  - Create a new Pull Request (PR) and fill in the information according to the PR Template format in the repository.
  - Provide a detailed description of the component's functionality, purpose, installation method, etc., in the PR.
  - Ensure that the files and information in the PR are complete and accurate.

### 4. Component Review

- The RuleGo team will review the submitted component. The review will cover the following aspects:
  - Functionality and stability of the component.
  - Compliance with RuleGo's design specifications and best practices.
  - Completeness and clarity of the component's documentation.
  - Conformance of the component's DSL file to specifications.
- The review will begin within 1 week. If there is a delay, the reviewer will notify the PR author through comments.
- During the review period, the author should actively respond to questions and feedback from the reviewer. Unresolved PR comments will be marked as outdated (can be reopened), and PR comments that remain unresolved for more than 30 days will be closed (cannot be reopened; a new PR will need to be created).
- After the component is merged into the main branch, it will be synchronized to the RuleGo Marketplace for users to use.

### 5. Component Release

- Once the component passes the review, it will be officially released on the RuleGo Marketplace.
- The author is responsible for maintaining the component, addressing issues reported by users, and handling feature requests.
- In the event of significant API changes, the author should promptly migrate the component. The RuleGo team will release change notices and migration guides in advance and provide necessary migration support.

## Notes

- **Uniqueness of the Component**: Ensure that your component offers unique functionality and value, avoiding redundancy with existing components. If your component is an optimization or improvement of an existing one, ensure that the improvements are significant and meaningful.
- **Compatibility of the Component**: Ensure that the component is compatible with the current version of RuleGo and specify the supported version range in the description.
- **Security of the Component**: Ensure that the component does not contain any malicious code or security vulnerabilities.

By following these steps, your component will be successfully published to the RuleGo Marketplace, bringing value to the community and gaining widespread application and recognition.
