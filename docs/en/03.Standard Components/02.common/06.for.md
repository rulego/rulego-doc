`for` component: <Badge text="v0.22.0+"/> A component for iteration. Used for iterating over arrays, slices, and structs, as well as for repeatedly executing a chain or sub-rule chain starting from a specified node.

## Configuration

| Field | Type   | Description                                                                                        | Default Value |
|-------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| range | string | The target expression for iteration                                                                | 1..3          |
| do    | string | Specifies the node or sub-rule chain for processing the iterated elements                          | s3            |
| mode  | int    | Mode of merging iteration results, 0 - Ignore, 1 - Append, 2 - Override, 3- Asynchronous execution | 0             |

**range**
- Supports iterating over arrays, slices, and structs. For example: msg.items iterates over msg.items,1..5 iterates over []int{1,2,3,4,5}
- If empty, iterates over the entire msg
- Access the message body through the `msg` variable; if the message's dataType is JSON, you can access the fields of msg by `msg.XX`. For example: `msg.items`
- Access message metadata through the `metadata` variable. For example `metadata.customerName`
- Access message type through the `msgType` variable
- Access data type through the `dataType` variable

Expression examples:
- msg.items iterates over msg.items
- 1..3 iterates over []int{1,2,3}, with do executed 3 times
>For more expr expression syntax, refer to: [expr](https://expr-lang.org/docs/language-definition)

**do**
- For example: "s1", item will start executing from the branch chain of s1, until the chain is completed, then return to the starting point of iteration
- An item can also be processed by a sub-rule chain, usage: chain:chainId, for example: chain:rule01, item will start executing from the sub-chain rule01, until the chain is completed, then return to the starting point of iteration

:::tip
- Access the current iteration index through metadata._loopIndex
- Access the current iterated item through metadata._loopItem
- Access the current iterated key through metadata._loopKey, which only has a value when iterating over a struct
- If the loop object is of type []interface{}, the value of the item will be passed to the processing node through msg.Data
:::
## Relation Type

- ***Success:*** If executed successfully, sends the message to the `Success` chain
- ***Failure:*** If execution fails, sends the message to the `Failure` chain

## Execution Result

- If sync=true, merge each iteration result and pass it to the next node; otherwise, do not modify msg.Data.
- `msg.metadata`: Will be modified by the iteration component.
## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "id": "s1",
  "type": "for",
  "name": "Iteration",
  "configuration": {
    "range": "msg.items",
    "do":        "s3"
  }
}
```
