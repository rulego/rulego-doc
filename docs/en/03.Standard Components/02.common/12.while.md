`while` component: Conditional loop node. It executes the target node or rule chain repeatedly as long as the specified condition is met.

## Configuration

| Field     | Type   | Description                                                                         | Default |
|:----------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|
| condition | string | The loop condition expression using `el` expression language. E.g., `msg.count==nil || msg.count < 5`. |  |
| do        | string | The Node ID or Sub-Rule Chain ID to execute in each iteration.                      |         |

## Relation Type

- ***Success:*** After the loop finishes, the message is passed along the `Success` chain.
- ***Failure:*** If an error occurs during expression evaluation or iteration, the message is passed along the `Failure` chain.

## Execution Result

Returns the result of the last iteration. The result of the previous iteration is used as input for the next iteration.

## Iteration Context Variables

During iteration, the component sets the following metadata variables:
- `_loopIndex`: Current iteration index (starting from 0).

## Breaking the Loop

If the message metadata contains `_break` with value `true` during iteration, the loop terminates immediately.

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "id": "s1",
  "type": "while",
  "name": "While Loop",
  "configuration": {
    "condition": "msg.count==nil || msg.count < 5",
    "do": "s2"
  }
}
```
