`RuleGo` is an architecture, based on which you can implement various solutions and applications. For RuleGo, visual configuration is only a part of its peripheral ecology.

However, to help you better understand, use and debug RuleGo features, and to better promote the project. We have carefully prepared a visual rule chain editor for you: RuleGo-Editor [Documentation](https://app.rulego.cc/en/) , experience address: [editor.rulego.cc](https://editor.rulego.cc/) .

## Usage

1. Use RuleGo-Editor online for free, create and edit your rule chains, and generate rule chain configuration files.
2. Connect to the [sample project](https://github.com/rulego/rulego/tree/main/examples/server) provided by RuleGo to experience the latest components provided by RuleGo, save, modify, debug rule chains and view the execution results of each node in the rule chain.
3. Embed it into your project with one line of code, support various flexible configurations, and integrate deeply with your project.
4. Develop on top of it, implement various low-code systems, and greatly save the workload of pre-investment.
5. For front-end beginners, it is a good research material for learning vue component development and logicFlow graphic development.
