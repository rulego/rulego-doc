OnChainBeforeInit Advice: Executes before the initialization of the rule engine. If an error is returned, creation fails.

## 接口

```go
// Order returns the execution order, the smaller the value, the higher the priority
Order() int
// New creates a new instance
New() Aspect
// OnChainBeforeInit is the advice that executes before the rule engine initialization.
OnChainBeforeInit(def *RuleChain) error
```
