Node before advice (Before Advice): executes before the node OnMsg method.

Before, After, Around Advice execution order: Around->Before->Around

## Interface

```go
// Order returns the execution order, the smaller the value, the higher the priority
Order() int
// New creates a new instance
New() Aspect
// PointCut declares a cut-in point, used to determine whether to execute the advice
//For example: specify some component types or relationType to execute the aspect logic;return ctx.Self().Type()=="mqttClient"
PointCut(ctx RuleContext, msg RuleMsg, relationType string) bool
// Before is the advice that executes before the node OnMsg method. The returned Msg will be used as the input for the next advice and the node OnMsg method.
