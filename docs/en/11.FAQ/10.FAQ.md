### RuleGo Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. How to limit the concurrent processing of rule chains?
Use the built-in [LimierAspect](/en/pages/aspect_limiter/) to limit the concurrent execution of rule chains. Example code:
```go
ruleEngine, err := rulego.New(chainId, ruleFile, types.WithAspects(&aspect.NewConcurrencyLimiterAspect(1)))
```

### 2. About rule engine execution interruption recovery?
For details, refer to: [About rule engine execution interruption recovery](/pages/4bb2d1/)

### 3. How to use RuleGo in other languages?
Use [RuleGo-Server](/en/pages/rulego-server/). First, run [RuleGo-Server](/en/pages/rulego-server/) as a middleware independently, and then use the `API` ([Documentation](https://apifox.com/apidoc/shared-d17a63fe-2201-4e37-89fb-f2e8c1cbaf40)) to execute or run specific rule chains.

### 4. Rule chain visualization?
We provide RuleGo-Editor as a tool for rule chain visualization. For details, refer to: [RuleGo-Editor](/en/pages/c0b811/)

### 5. What is the difference between endpoint components and node components?
Endpoint components are used to receive external data or generate data and forward it to the rule engine. Node components are components within the rule engine used to process data within the rule engine.
Endpoint components do not allow inputs and only have outputs.
