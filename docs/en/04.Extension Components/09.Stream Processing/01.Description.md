# Stream Processing Components

RuleGo provides stream processing components based on the [StreamSQL](/pages/streamsql-overview/) engine, supporting real-time data processing using SQL syntax.

## Component List

### [streamTransform](/pages/x-stream-transform/)
**Node Type:** `x/streamTransform`

Stream Transformer component, used to handle non-aggregate SQL queries, supports:
- Data filtering and field selection
- Field renaming and calculation
- Conditional filtering and data validation
- Single and batch data processing
- 60+ built-in function support

**Applicable Scenarios:** Real-time data cleaning, format conversion, simple calculation

### [streamAggregator](/pages/x-stream-aggregator/)
**Node Type:** `x/streamAggregator`

Stream Aggregator component, used to handle aggregate SQL queries, supports:
- Window aggregation (Tumbling Window, Sliding Window, Count Window, etc.)
- Group aggregation and multi-dimensional statistics
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, etc.)
- Real-time calculation and result output

**Applicable Scenarios:** Real-time statistical analysis, monitoring alarms, data summarization

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
go get github.com/rulego/rulego-components
```

### 2. Register Components

```go
import _ "github.com/rulego/rulego-components/stats/streamsql"
```

### 3. Usage Examples

#### Data Transformation Example
```json
{
  "id": "transform1",
  "type": "x/streamTransform",
  "name": "Temperature Conversion",
  "configuration": {
    "sql": "SELECT deviceId, temperature, temperature * 1.8 + 32 as temp_fahrenheit FROM stream WHERE temperature > 0"
  }
}
```

#### Data Aggregation Example
```json
{
  "id": "aggregator1",
  "type": "x/streamAggregator",
  "name": "Temperature Statistics",
  "configuration": {
    "sql": "SELECT deviceId, AVG(temperature) as avg_temp, COUNT(*) as count FROM stream GROUP BY deviceId, TumblingWindow('5m')"
  }
}
```

## Application Scenarios

### IoT Data Processing
- Sensor data cleaning and formatting
- Real-time monitoring of indicators such as temperature and humidity
- Device status statistics and alarms

### Real-time Monitoring
- System performance indicator aggregation
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- Real-time dashboard data processing

### Data Analysis
- Stream data preprocessing
- Real-time statistical calculation
- Multi-dimensional data analysis
