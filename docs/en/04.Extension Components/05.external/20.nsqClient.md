`x/nsqClient` component: <Badge text="v0.33.0+"/> NSQ producer component. Used to publish messages to specified NSQ topics.

## Configuration

This component supports reusing shared NSQ connection clients through the `server` field to avoid creating duplicate connections. See [Component Connection Reuse](/en/pages/baa05d/).

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                                                   | Default Value   |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| server      | string | Yes      | NSQ server address, supports multiple formats:<br/>1. Single nsqd: "127.0.0.1:4150"<br/>2. Multiple nsqd: "127.0.0.1:4150,127.0.0.1:4151"<br/>3. Lookupd address: "http://127.0.0.1:4161,http://127.0.0.1:4162" | 127.0.0.1:4150 |
| topic       | string | Yes      | Publish topic, supports using [Component Configuration Variables](/en/pages/baa05c/) for dynamic configuration | device_msg     |
| authToken   | string | No       | NSQ authentication token                                      | None           |
| certFile    | string | No       | TLS certificate file path                                     | None           |
| certKeyFile | string | No       | TLS private key file path                                     | None           |

## Working Principle

1. The component initializes by connecting to the NSQ server based on configuration
2. Supports connecting to single or multiple nsqd instances, also supports discovering nsqd through lookupd
3. Upon receiving a message, publishes the message content to the specified topic
4. Routes through Success chain upon successful publishing, routes through Failure chain on failure
5. The component automatically manages connection lifecycle, including reconnection

## Relation Type

- ***Success:*** Message is sent to `Success` chain in the following cases:
  - Message successfully published to NSQ server
  - Received confirmation from NSQ server
- ***Failure:*** Message is sent to `Failure` chain in the following cases:
  - Failed to connect to NSQ server
  - Failed to publish message
  - Configuration parameter error
  - TLS certificate loading failure

## Execution Result

After component execution:
- msg.data remains unchanged
- metadata remains unchanged
- msgType remains unchanged

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "id": "s5",
  "type": "x/nsqClient",
  "name": "Publish to NSQ",
  "debugMode": true,
  "configuration": {
    "server": "127.0.0.1:4150",
    "topic": "device.msg.${deviceType}",
    "authToken": "your-auth-token"
  }
}
```
