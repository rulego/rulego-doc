**Endpoint** is a module that abstracts different input source data routing and provides a **consistent** user experience for different protocols. It is an optional module of `RuleGo` that enables RuleGo to run independently and provide services.

It allows you to easily create and start different receiving services, such as http, mqtt, kafka, gRpc, websocket, schedule, tpc, udp, etc., to achieve data integration of heterogeneous systems, and then perform conversion, processing, flow, etc. operations according to different requests or messages, and finally hand them over to the rule chain or component for processing.
