***Schedule Endpoint*** is used to create and start scheduled tasks. Use cron expressions to define the task trigger time.

## Type

endpoint/schedule

## Startup configuration

None

## Configure cron

router.From configures the cron expression. For example:
```go
  //Execute every 1 second
  router1 := endpoint.NewRouter().From("*/1 * * * * *").Process(func(router *endpoint.Router, exchange *endpoint.Exchange) bool {
      exchange.In.GetMsg().Type = "TEST_MSG_TYPE1"
      fmt.Println("router1 执行...", time.Now().UnixMilli())
      //Business logic, such as reading files, regularly pulling some data to the rule chain for processing

      return true
  }).
//Specify which rule chain ID to process
To("chain:default").End()
```
Other parameters, refer to [route Router](/en/pages/45008b/) definition.

## cron format

cron expression represents a set of times, using 6 fields separated by spaces. For example: * * * * * * The fields from left to right represent:

| Field        | Required | Allowed values      | Allowed special characters |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Seconds      | Yes      | 0-59                | * / , -                    |
| Minutes      | Yes      | 0-59                | * / , -                    |
| Hours        | Yes      | 0-23                | * / , -                    |
| Day of month | Yes      | 1-31                | * / , - ?                  |
| Month        | Yes      | 1-12 or JAN-DEC     | * / , -                    |
| Day of week  | Yes      | 0-6 or SUN-SAT      | * / , - ?                  |

> Note: The values of the Month and Day of week fields are not case sensitive. "SUN", "Sun" and "sun" are all allowed.

You can also use a few predefined variables to replace the cron expression.

| Variable               | Description                                     | Equivalent to |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| @yearly (or @annually) | Run once at 0 o'clock on January 1 every year   | 0 0 0 1 1 *   |
| @monthly               | Run once at 0 o'clock on the 1st of every month | 0 0 0 1 * *   |
| @weekly                | Run once at 0 o'clock every Sunday              | 0 0 0 * * 0   |
| @daily (or @midnight)  | Run once at 0 o'clock every day                 | 0 0 0 * * *   |
| @hourly                | Run once every hour on the hour                 | 0 0 * * * *   |


## Example

```go
scheduleEndpoint := endpoint.New(schedule.Type, config, nil)

//Execute every 1 second
router1 := endpoint.NewRouter().From("*/1 * * * * *").Process(func(router *endpoint.Router, exchange *endpoint.Exchange) bool {
  exchange.In.GetMsg().Type = "TEST_MSG_TYPE1"
  fmt.Println("router1 执行...", time.Now().UnixMilli())
  //Business logic, such as reading files, regularly pulling some data to the rule chain for processing
  return true
}).
//Specify which rule chain ID to process
To("chain:default").End()
//Add task route
routeId1, err := scheduleEndpoint.AddRouter(router1)
//Start task
err = scheduleEndpoint.Start()
