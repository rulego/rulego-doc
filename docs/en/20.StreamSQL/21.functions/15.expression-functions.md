# StreamSQL Expression Functions

Expression functions are used for dynamic expression calculation.

## EXPRESSION - Expression Function
**Syntax**: `expression(expr_str)`  
**Description**: Dynamically calculates an expression string.  
**Incremental Calculation**: Not Supported  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT expression('price * quantity') as total FROM orders
```

## EXPR - Expression Function (Abbreviation)
**Syntax**: `expr(expr_str)`  
**Description**: Dynamically calculates an expression string (abbreviated form of EXPRESSION).  
**Incremental Calculation**: Not Supported  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT expr('temperature > 30') as is_hot FROM sensors
```

## Incremental Calculation Explanation

### Performance Advantages
Functions that support incremental calculation have significant performance advantages in stream processing:
- **Memory Efficiency**: No need to save historical data
- **Calculation Efficiency**: Avoids repeated calculations
- **Real-time**: Results are updated in real-time
