# StreamSQL Case Studies

This chapter provides practical application cases of StreamSQL in various real-world business scenarios, covering common stream processing requirements such as data merging, change data capture, real-time analysis, etc. All cases are based on the actual source code of the StreamSQL project to ensure executability and practicality.

## Case Categories

### 📊 Data Merging
- [Single Stream Data Merging](/en/pages/streamsql-merge-single/) - Data merging within the same data stream
- [Multi-Stream Data Merging](/en/pages/streamsql-merge-multi/) - Merging processing between multiple data streams

### 📈 Real-time Analysis
- [Real-time Data Analysis](/en/pages/streamsql-realtime-analysis/) - Real-time indicator calculation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis

### 🔄 Change Data Capture
- [Change Data Capture](/en/pages/streamsql-cdc/) - Database change monitoring and real-time synchronization processing

### 🏢 Business Scenarios
- [Business Scenario Applications](/en/pages/streamsql-business-scenarios/) - Practical business scenarios in e-commerce, finance, IoT, etc.
