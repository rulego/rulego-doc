# Overview

## A New Choice for Stream Computing

In traditional stream data processing scenarios, developers usually face two extreme choices:

- **Time-series Database Solutions**: Such as InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, etc., while having strong storage capabilities, their real-time computing capabilities are limited and complex aggregation operations have poor performance.
- **Distributed Framework Solutions**: Such as Apache Flink, Apache Storm, etc., while powerful, they have complex deployment, huge resource consumption, and are not suitable for edge environments.

**StreamSQL provides a third choice**: a lightweight stream processing engine designed specifically for edge computing, capable of real-time aggregation operations on massive data in resource-constrained environments, filling the gap between lightweight and high performance.

### 🌐 Typical Application Scenarios

**Edge-Cloud Collaborative Architecture**: In IoT and Industry 4.0 scenarios, a large number of sensors and devices generate massive amounts of raw data. Direct upload to the cloud would cause:
- Huge network bandwidth pressure
- High cloud computing costs
- Real-time requirements cannot be met

**StreamSQL's Solution**:
```
Massive raw data → Edge StreamSQL processing → Aggregated results → Cloud storage/analysis
   (TB level)        (real-time filtering/aggregation)      (MB level)      (long-term storage)
```

**Specific Scenario Examples**:
- **Smart Factory**: 1000 devices generate 100,000 data points per second, edge real-time aggregation to 100 key indicators per minute
- **Smart City**: Environmental data from thousands of sensors, edge preprocessing only uploads abnormal events and statistical summaries
- **Connected Vehicles**: Fleet real-time data aggregated at edge gateway, only sending driving behavior analysis and abnormal alerts to the cloud

## What is StreamSQL

StreamSQL is a lightweight stream processing engine designed specifically for IoT edge scenarios. It uses familiar SQL syntax to process unbounded data streams, allowing developers to implement complex real-time data analysis with simple SQL statements. It can also be integrated as a [RuleGo](https://rulego.cc) component into the RuleGo ecosystem, leveraging its rich input/output and data processing component library and rule engine capabilities.
